# GpuOptimizationProject
This is a project that showcases GPU/parallel programming using parallel primitives like reduction. Starting from a na√Øve implementation we will go on making improvements and along the way, we will learn about GPU architecture and how to optimize/best practices. 

The main purpose behind this effort is to program and using profiling tools look at areas for improvement. I find very less examples where we see code profile dumps and explanations on how to make sense of it and find areas of improvement in code.
